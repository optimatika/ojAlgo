/**
 * Interface for sparse matrix implementations that store only non-zero elements.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines the contract for sparse matrix structures, which are optimized for storing matrices
 * where most elements are zero. Implementations typically use specialized data structures like Compressed
 * Sparse Row (CSR), Compressed Sparse Column (CSC), or Coordinate Format (COO) to efficiently store and
 * access non-zero elements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The interface provides methods to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Convert the sparse matrix to a list of {@link Triplet}s representing non-zero elements</li>
 * <li>Calculate the density of the matrix (ratio of non-zero elements to total elements)</li>
 * </ul>
