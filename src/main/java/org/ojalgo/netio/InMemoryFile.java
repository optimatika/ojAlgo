/**
 * An in-memory "file" that can be used with some {@link ToFileWriter} and/or {@link FromFileReaderr}
 * implementations instead of a {@link File}.
 * <p>
 * To dynamically create file contents that only exist in memory (for download): Feed an instance of
 * {@link InMemoryFile} rather than {@link File} to a {@link ToFileWriter} that support doing so (like the
 * {@link TextLineWriter}), and keep a reference to the {@link InMemoryFile} instance. When done writing you
 * get the (file) contents from that instance.
 * <p>
 * To parse some data you have in memory: Create an instance of {@link InMemoryFile} using one of the
 * constructors that take <code>byte[]</code> or {@link String} as input, and feed that to a
 * {@link FromFileReader} that support doing so (like the {@link TextLineReader}).
 * <p>
 * Note that you can obtain both {@link OutputStream} and {@link InputStream} instances from an
 * {@link InMemoryFile} – you can write to AND (later) read from the same instance.
 * <p>
 * This class is essentially a <code>byte[]</code> wrapper making use of {@link ByteArrayInputStream} and
 * {@link ByteArrayOutputStream}.
