/**
 * The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given
 * number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time and/or space if these events occur with a known
 * average rate and independently of the time since the last event. (The Poisson distribution can also be used
 * for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.) Distribution of
 * number of points in random point process under certain simple assumptions. Approximation to the binomial
 * distribution when aCount is large and aProbability is small. aLambda = aCount * aProbability.
