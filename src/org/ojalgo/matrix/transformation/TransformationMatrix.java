/**
 * <p>
 * Represents an in-place vector transformation â€“ the matrix/vector operated on is mutated. A
 * TransformationMatrix instance represents an implied transformation matrix. But, this interface does not
 * require you to disclose the size and shape of that matrix, nor to be able to explicitly access any of the
 * individual elements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A vector transfomation is normally defind as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * [transformed vector] = [transformation matrix] x [original vector]
 * </pre>
 *
 * Here we make some specialisation and generalisation to that definition:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The target vector/matrix is not restricted to be a vector - it can be a matrix of any size/shape.</li>
 * <li>The target vector/matrix is transformed in-place.</li>
 * <li>Not restricted to transformations that can be expressed as premultiplication by some matrix - you can
 * transform the target vector/matrix any way you want.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
