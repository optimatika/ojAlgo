 * <li>[D] is a diagonal matrix. Possibly bi-, tri- or block-diagonal.</li>
 * <li>[H] is an, upper or lower, Hessenberg matrix.</il>
 * <li>[I] is an identity matrix - obvioulsly orthogonal/unitary.</li>
 * <li>[L] is a lower (left) triangular matrix.</li>
 * <li>[P] is a permutation matrix - an identity matrix with interchanged rows or columns - and orthogonal/unitary.</li>
 * <li>[Q] is an orthogonal/unitary matrix. [Q]<sup>-1</sup> = [Q]<sup>H</sup>, and with real matrices =
