/**
 * <p>
 * LDU: [A] = [L][D][U] ( [P1][L][D][U][P2] )
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>[A] can be any matrix.</li>
 * <li>[L] is a unit lower (left) triangular matrix. It has the same number of rows as [A], and ones on the
 * diagonal.</li>
 * <li>[D] is a square diagonal matrix.</li>
 * <li>[U] is a unit upper (right) triangular matrix. It has the same number of columns as [A], and ones on
 * the diagonal.</li>
 * <li>[P1] is a permutation matrix (row pivot order).</li>
 * <li>[P2] is a permutation matrix (column pivot order).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Row and/or column permutations may not be necessary and are therefore optional. Numerical stability usually
 * does require ordering of either the rows or columns (most algorithms reorder rows).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Solving the equation system [A][X]=[B] turns into this [L][D][U][X] = [B] and is solved in these steps:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>[L][Z]=[B] ( [Z] = [D][U][X] )</li>
 * <li>[D][Y]=[Z] ( [Y] = [U][X] )</li>
 * <li>[U][X]=[Y]</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * [A]<sup>H</sup> = [U]<sup>H</sup>[D]<sup>H</sup>[L]<sup>H</sup>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ojAlgo does not have a full/general LDU decompositions but contains 3 variations of it:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>LU: [A] = [L][U] where [U<sub>LU</sub>] = [D<sub>LDU</sub>][U<sub>LDU</sub>]</li>
 * <li>Cholesky: [A] = [L][L]<sup>H</sup> where [A] is hermitian positive definite and [L<sub>Cholesky</sub>]
 * = [L<sub>LDU</sub>][D<sub>LDU</sub>]<sup>Â½</sup></li>
 * <li>LDL: [A] = [L][D][L]<sup>H</sup> where [A] is hermitian and [L<sub>LDL</sub>]<sup>H</sup> = [U
 * <sub>LDU</sub>]</li>
 * </ul>
