/**
 * Tridiagonal: [A] = [Q][D][Q]<sup>H</sup> Any square symmetric (hermitian) matrix [A] can be factorized by similarity
 * transformations into the form, [A]=[Q][D][Q]<sup>-1</sup> where [Q] is an orthogonal (unitary) matrix and [D] is a
 * real symmetric tridiagonal matrix. Note that [D] can/should be made real even when [A] has complex elements. Since
 * [Q] is orthogonal (unitary) [Q]<sup>-1</sup> = [Q]<sup>H</sup> and when it is real [Q]<sup>H</sup> = [Q]<sup>T</sup>.
