/**
 * <p>
 * A vector space is a set of objects called vectors, where a vector is a tuple of fields/scalars/numbers.
 * Each vector space has two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. Eight axioms must be
 * satisfied. The first four are the group axioms of the additive group of vectors. The remaining four relates
 * to scalar multiplication, and are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication: a(bV) = (ab)V</li>
 * <li>Identity element of scalar multiplication: 1V = V, where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity of the
 * field.</li>
 * <li>Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition: a(U + V) = aU + aV</li>
 * <li>Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition: (a + b)V = aV + bV</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * To enable the use of existing Java classes as scalars this interface declares the scalar type to be a
 * subclass of {@linkplain Comparable} (think {@linkplain Number}) rather than an implementation of
 * {@linkplain Field}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any field is also a vector space in itself.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> The vector type
 * @param <N> The scalar type
