/**
 * <p>
 * A field is a commutative ring (even the multiplication operation) with notions of addition, subtraction,
 * multiplication, and division. Any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the
 * standard general context for linear algebra.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A division ring is a ring in which division is possible. Division rings differ from fields only in that
 * their multiplication is not required to be commutative. In terms of a Java interface/class there is no need
 * to differentiate between a field and a division ring.
