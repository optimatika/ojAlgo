/**
 * <p>
 * A group is a set of elements paired with a binary operation. Four conditions called the group axioms must
 * be satisfied:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Closure: If A and B are both members of the set then the result of A op B is also a member.</li>
 * <li>Associativity: Invocation/execution order doesn't matter - ((A op B) op C) == (A op (B op C))</li>
 * <li>The identity property: There is an identity element in the set, I, so that I op A == A op I == A</li>
 * <li>The inverse property: For each element in the set there must be an inverse element (opposite or
 * reciprocal) so that A<sup>-1</sup> op A == A op A<sup>-1</sup> == I</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that commutativity is not a requirement - A op B doesn't always have to be equal to B op A. If the
 * operation is commutative then the group is called an abelian group or simply a commutative group.
 * </p>
