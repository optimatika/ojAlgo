         * The gradient of a scalar field is a vector field that points in the direction of the greatest rate of

         * space of any quantity can be represented (e.g. graphically) by a slope. The gradient represents the steepness
         * and direction of that slope. The Jacobian is a generalization of the gradient. Gradients are only defined on
         * scalar-valued functions, but Jacobians are defined on vector- valued functions. When f is real-valued (i.e.,
         * f : Rn → R) the derivative Df(x) is a 1 × n matrix, i.e., it is a row vector. Its transpose is called the
         * gradient of the function: ∇f(x) = Df(x)<sup>T</sup> , which is a (column) vector, i.e., in Rn. Its components
         * are the partial derivatives of f: The first-order approximation of f at a point x ∈ int dom f can be
