This directory contains the Maros and Meszaros (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~im/)
set of convex quadratic programming test problems.

The problems are all in QPS format, which is itself a subset of SIF.
The problems have been classified according to the CUTE classification
system (see, Bongartz, Conn, Gould and Toint, ACM Transactions on
Mathematical Software 21, 1995, pp.  123-160), and have been slightly
reformatted for consistency.

The QP problems are assumed to be in the following form:

min f(x) = c_0 + c^T x + 1/2 x^T Q x,  Q symmetric and positive
                                       semidefinite
subject to      A x = b,
                l <= x <= u.

For further details see I. Maros, Cs. Meszaros: A Repository of Convex
Quadratic Programming Problems, Optimization Methods and Software, 1999.

The set of convex quadratic problems can also be found in the following
three compressed (zipped) files: QPDATA1, QPDATA2 and QPDATA3 in the
"Selection of Data files" section of http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~im/ .
They were originally organized in the following way.  QPDATA1 contains
76 problems from the CUTE library. 46 problems provided by the Brunel
optimization group are in QPDATA2, while the other 16 problems from
miscellaneous sources are located in QPDATA3.  Data in some problem
files contain exponents.  The exponent indicator is always `e'.  All the
files had the .qps extension.

There is another web site holding the same set of problems in a slightly
different structure:  ftp://ftp.sztaki.hu/pub/oplab/QPDATA is an
anonymous ftp site with three subdirectories corresponding to the above
three zip files.  Here, the subdirectories contain individual zip files
of the problems.

The zipped files can be unzipped by using either "pkunzip", or the
freely available "unzip" program.  The latter can be downloaded from
Info-ZIP: http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/UnZp.html.

Important note:  The .qps files are DOS type text files.  Therefore,
under UNIX it is advisable to use "unzip -aa ..." command to get the
correct UNIX text format of end-of-line.

Both web sites of QPDATA problems are maintained and new problem
instances may be added.  We keep the library open to further
contributions.  Anybody with such an intent should contact
one of the following people by Email:
