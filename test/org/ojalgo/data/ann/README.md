# Stairs Data

#### Description
This data consists of 2x2 grayscale images, each pixel with an intensity value ranging from 0 (white) to 255 (black). The data itself is a representation of those images, 1 row per image with columns R1C1, R1C2, R2C1, R2C2 representing the pixels "top row, left", "top row, right", "bottom row, left" and "bottom row, right". The file data_generation.R can be modified to generate more or different samples of stairs/not stairs.
