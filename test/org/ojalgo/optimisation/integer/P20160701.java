/**
 * <p>
 * I am trying to call Ojalgo 40 from AnyLogic 7.3.2 (http://www.anylogic..com/downloads) on Ubuntu 16.04 in
 * order to solve a Traveling Salesman Problem, but Ojalgo sometimes stops on a feasible solution before the
 * optimum. The following code works well without Anylogic and always finds 917.31 as optimal solution:
 * (Simply copy/paste the following code in a file called "Tsp.java" in order to test it.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Next, I try to run the same code in the "On startup" section of the "Agent actions" of the "Main" agent in
 * an AnyLogic model. (Click on the project name "Ojalgo" to change the location of ojalgo-40.0.0.jar, like in
 * the attached file.) Unfortunately, the obtained result is not always 917.31, but also sometimes 1099.22 and
 * 1161.84. I do not understand why the solution randomly changes. I also call Cplex from AnyLogic to solve
 * this same problem, which always returns the optimal solution, hence the problem seems not to be due to
 * AnyLogic. As shown by the above Java code, the problem is not due to Ojalgo as well, but only related to
 * the coupling of AnyLogic and Ojalgo. Thank you very much for Ojalgo and your help!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * apete: ExpressionsBasedModel has a feature that automatically rescales model parameters (to maximize
 * numerical accuracy) before invoking the solver. The current implementation of that feature (apparently)
 * doesn?t work very well with extremely large parameters in the model. I have now modified the behavior of
 * that feature to not scale anything when/if there are extremely large or small parameters present. As far as
 * I can see that solves the problem with your model.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * apete (later): Have also improved the presolve functionality to fix (not-include) uncorrelated and/or
 * unbounded variables. (Doesn't handle every case, but this one a a few more.) This was the real fix for this
 * problem!
 * </p>
